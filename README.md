## Accelerated Mobile Pages for Magento

'Mobile web is slow, clunky and [a] frustrating experience' - [AMP Home Page](https://www.ampproject.org/) 

Magento 1.x is in the extreme of slow, the only real thing we can do is cache and use a good CDN. We can make that experience better, by using AMPs to create a read-only/browse-only version of your store you can speed up the time it takes for someone to get from search->product view.

## Why Read Only?
Magento 1.x needs JavaScript to do almost anything on the platform. ~~Because I wanted to get this out fast~~ For that reason when creating this package I decided to put together a barebones example of AMP's for Magento.

# More information on AMP⚡
[AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) is a way to build web pages for static content that render with reliable, fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.

If you are creating AMP pages, check out the docs on [ampproject.org](https://www.ampproject.org/).

## Do not suffer a loss in traffic
Google is moving to promote sites that use AMP to the top of the search rankings in a carousel feature. Don't leave your fans behind when you could make a stupidly simple change. Most importantly the big guys wont have this yet. Win win.

## Installation
**1. TO DO**

## Tests
I would test this code, but I really do not know how to do that. If someone would like to contribute with tests that would be awesome.
